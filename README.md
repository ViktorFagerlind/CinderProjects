CinderProjects
==============

Do this to compile the projects:
1. Download and install Visual Studio 2013
2. Clone this repository to a folder, e.g. 'CinderDevelopment'.
3. Download cinder for Visual C++ 2013 from here: http://libcinder.org/download/
4. Extract the root folder of cinder to your 'CinderDevelopment' folder
5. Rename the extracted folder to just 'cinder' (instead of for example 'cinder_0.8.6_vc2013')
6. Open 'CinderDevelopment/CinderProjects/CinderProjects.sln' and compile!
